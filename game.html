                        <p>‘Tossing the stones’ or mainly known as batu seremban is a traditional game that involves at least 2 players or more. It is usually played with few small round stones or pebbles. Besides small stones, a small triangular or round shaped cloth bag filled with saga seeds are also used as a substitute to stones. In addition, this game is usually played at home, in a park or anywhere clean during their leisure time. As they found the perfect spot, they will sit on the floor in a circle and play in turns. They aim of the game is to collect each “batu” as they toss one on to the air, and they must collect the stone on the ground and then catch the tossed stone. Do these five consecutive times in one turn until there’s no stones/bags on the ground, you survive. If failed, you’re eliminated. The winner is determined until there’s only one person left survived.</p>

                        <p>Derived from the Malay term "congak" signifying mental arithmetic, Congkak is a two-player game. It involves wooden boards with 16 to 18 compartments arranged in two rows.In the more commonly played 16-hole version, seven compartments serve as "houses" within the "kampong" (village), while the final two larger compartments are "rumah" (storehouses) situated at both ends of the board. The number of seeds (counters) in each hole corresponds to the total number of houses in the village. The objective is to accumulate the greatest number of seeds in one's storehouses. As the name implies, the game necessitates mental calculations to plan future moves and gain an advantage in collecting points.</p>

                            Gasing Pangkah, also known as the Spinning Top Game, is a traditional Malay game that is popular in Malaysia. It involves spinning a top, known as "gasing," and competing to see whose top spins the longest or stays within a designated area. The game is played by winding a string around the gasing and then releasing it to spin on the ground. Players use a stick to spin the top and keep it spinning by striking it gently. Gasing Pangkah is not just a game but also a cultural tradition that promotes skill, patience, and camaraderie among players.</p>

                        <p>IThe Shuttlecock, evolved from an ancient military exercise. Shuttlecock matches were popular in the time of the Han and T’ang Dynasties (207-906 A.D.). After the Sung Dynasty (960-1279 A.D.) the game was called Chien-tsu, the Chinese word for “arrow” which sounds the same as the word for “shuttlecock."
                            The shuttlecock consists of a small, weighted circular base with feathers or tassels at one end. It is generally kicked with the toe, heel, instep and inner and outer side of the foot as well as the knee. The kick is from a jump rather than a stationary position.
                            Two levels of the game are called the “Lesser Accomplishments,” which calls for kicking with one foot, and the “Greater Accomplishments,” which use both feet. Tricks require the use of other parts of the body. “Ivory Chopsticks” calls for catching the kicked shuttlecock between two fingers.
                            This was a cold-weather game, since the vigorous exercise warmed the body. In 1975, the Taiwanese government included shuttlecock in the elementary school physical education program, which revived its popularity.</p>

                        <p>The diabolo is a traditional Chinese toy composed of two equally-sized discs connected by a long axle. To keep it spinning, it's attached to a string secured to two sticks at its ends, with each stick held in one hand. Nowadays, it serves as both a children's toy and a tool for performances, especially in juggling and occasionally in Chinese ethnic dance. A wide range of tricks can be performed with the Chinese yo-yo, ranging from simple actions like tossing it into the air to more complex maneuvers such as spinning it around the user's back.</p>

                        <p>
                            Kabaddi is a popular contact team sport that originated in ancient India and is now played in various forms across South Asia, and other parts of the world. It is the national game of Bangladesh and is the state game of Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Telangana, and Maharashtra in India. The game is known for its simplicity and requires no equipment to play, making it accessible to all.
                            <br><br>
                            In kabaddi, two teams compete against each other, and the aim of the game is to score points by raiding into the opposing team's half and touching as many of their players as possible without being tackled and held by them. The raider must chant "kabaddi, kabaddi" repeatedly to show that they are making the raid on a single breath. If the raider is tackled and unable to return to their half, they are out, and the opposing team earns a point. The game is fast-paced and requires both physical strength and strategic thinking.</p>

                        <p>
                            Carrom is a tabletop game that is popular in many countries, especially in South Asia. It is similar to billiards or pool but played with a different set of rules and equipment. The game is typically played by two or four players, with each player taking turns to strike the carrom men (playing pieces) with a striker to pot them into one of the four corner pockets of the board.
                            <br><br>
                            The objective of the game is to pot all of one's carrom men and the queen (a designated red carrom man) before the opponent(s) do so. Players earn points for each carrom man and the queen they pot, with the queen carrying the highest point value. The player or team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.</p>
